I'm start running 6 month ago and now i'm quite into the running community and i'm loving it.
While running i start to feel better and i know a lot of people sharing the same hobby and i'm starting wonder if i can something to make the community better

# The problem

one problem i faced while running is the lack of data viability and visualization ... i mean, Strava ( the app i and almost every runner use ) offer some chart of your activities but is not enough for a geek like me ... So i decide to do something to resolve this issue 

# The idea 

what if i make a webapp to display data that strava doesn't display ? and also add some other fancy feature and information like UTMB race estimation time ecc .. ?
i just like this idea and came up with a solution in some days that i'll publish in the end of January 

## How my web app works

## Strava API 

Strava allow an authenticated app to retrieve data of an authenticated user if he allow the app to do so, and i just use this functionality to get the data of any runner that use my app
