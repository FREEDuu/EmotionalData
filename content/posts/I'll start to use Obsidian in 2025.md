## Why i'll start

Because i'm start to feel the necessity of producing something instead of consuming , i want to share value and learn every day something new.
i'd like to become a pro in writing beautiful markdown and rephrase ideas, building knowledge basically is what i want to focus in this 2025

## I'll setup all my ideas and notes/information

Using Obsidian i'll track everything i learn this year and in 2026 i'll see if obsidian is a valid tool to do so, i want to share also everything i learn and know in a public and simple solution.

## The Big and Final idea

The big idea is to create an online and easy shareable graph of my knowledge in the future, something like the graph view of obsidian but open source and easier.
I'd like also to create a social-like platform where you can see other's graph view and share your own one.
