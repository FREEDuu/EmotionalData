# I need some serious commitment

## Why i need that ?

During this personal life time, i feel like i'm swapping between too many projects and ideas ... with some progress also and this is getting me excited :D
My personal Telegram BOT is really cool and i like it ... i also start a webapp with a Youtuber on a topic i'm very interested in

However i feel like i'm not doing enough ... i try to find a 'real' job but i just apply to lots of job offer and never get a feedback

I also want to take notes more seriously but i'm not really doing it 
So i decided to start time-boxing my life and see what happen in results !

## Why time boxing

I have lots of idea and sometimes i'm overwelmed by it, so i choose to focus for x amount of time in just a very tiny and detailed idea and develop it
i hope this will help me to be more productive and efficient 

## i'll post some result and feedback within 2 week of time-boxing
